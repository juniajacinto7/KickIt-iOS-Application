## Overview
### Description
KickIt is a casual hangout app that allows users to mark interesting locations on a map for their friends and, if they choose, other users. Users can create location invites that prompt friends and/or other users on their devices. The app provides directions for users that accept the invites.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Social Media / Travel
- **Mobile:** KickIt would primarily be more effective on mobile but future development for laptops and desktops may be viable for providing more access options for users.
- **Story:** Provides a map layout which users can place markers and images onto. The markers have an extra option for invites that users can fill out and send to friends and/or random users. The app sends a notification and an invite to the sendee and if the sendee clicks accept then the map sends directons.
- **Market:** This app is free-to-use and available to everyone. However, filters can be applied by users to hone in on certain markers. Users can also block invites on their device. Users can set an age limit for more explicit locations.
- **Habit:** Users can use this app for setting up parties and other events at specific locations so usage depends on how socially active the user is.
- **Scope:** In early stages, KickIt will probably be limited to marking interesting locations and sending invites. With further development, providing directions may become a later feature. The app may feature hotspots and videos for locations similar to Snapchat's SnapMaps. Potential integration into Snapchat and other social media platforms.
